# MongoDB Service
# Provides stable DNS name for backend to connect to database
# Type: ClusterIP (internal only - NOT exposed to internet)

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb-service
  namespace: tiptrack
spec:
  type: ClusterIP  # Internal only
  selector:
    app: mongodb  # Routes to pods with label app=mongodb
  ports:
    - port: 27017  
      targetPort: 27017  
      protocol: TCP
      name: mongodb
  
# HOW IT WORKS:
# Backend connects to: mongodb-service:27017
# Kubernetes DNS resolves this to the MongoDB pod IP
# Traffic stays INSIDE the cluster (secure!)
