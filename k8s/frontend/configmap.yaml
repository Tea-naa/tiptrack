# Frontend ConfigMap
# Stores API URL for the React app

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: frontend-config
  namespace: tiptrack
data:
  # API URL that frontend uses to connect to backend
  VITE_API_URL: "http://backend-service:5000/api/shifts"

# NOTE: In Minikube, this won't work directly from browser
# because browser can't resolve "backend-service"
# We'll use Minikube tunneling or NodePort for actual access

# PRODUCTION SETUP:
# In real production, you'd use an Ingress controller and
# set this to your actual domain: https://api.tiptrack.com/api/shifts
